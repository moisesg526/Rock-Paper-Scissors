# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is the same game we always played as a child. You enter one of the three selections Rock, Paper, or Scissors into the prompt to make your pick. Once you made your pick the computer randomly picks one. 
 - Rock beats Scissors but loses to Paper. 
 - Paper beats Rock but loses to Scissors.
 - Scissors beats Paper but loses to Rock.
 
The game is played in the console.
